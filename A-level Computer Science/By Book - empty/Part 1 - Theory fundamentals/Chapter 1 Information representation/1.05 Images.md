# Vector graphic
> $Vector \space graphic$: a graphic consisting of drawing objects defined in a drawing list
> 
> $Drawing \space object$: a component defined by geometric formulae and associated properties
> 
> $Drawing \space list$: contains one set of values for each drawing object 
> 
> $Property$: defines one aspect of the appearance of the drawing object

# Bitmaps

> $Picture \space element (pixel)$: the smallest identifiable component of a bitmap image, defined by just two properties: its position in the bitmap matrix and its colour 
> 
> $Colour \space depth$: the number of bits used to represent one pixel
> 
> $Bit \space depth$: the number of bits used to represent each of the red, green and blue colours 
> 
> $Image \space resolution$: the number of pixels in the bitmap file defined as the product of the width and the height values 
> 
> $Screen \space resolution$: the product of width and height values for the number of pixels that the screen can display

$File \space header$: a set of bytes at the beginning of a bitmap file which identifies the file and contains information about the coding used
