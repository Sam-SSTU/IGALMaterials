File size (bits) = sampling frequency (Hz) x sampling depth (bits) x length of sound (s) x channels

*Example*:
A stereo song has to be recorded at CD quality. The song is 4 minutes and 8 seconds long. How much disk space would the captured song occupy?

Settings for CD quality are:
Sampling frequency = 44100 Hz (44.1KHz)
Sampling depth = 16 bit

Length of song = 4 x 60 + 8 = 248 seconds

File size (bits) = 44100 x 16 x 248 x 2 = 349977600
File size (bytes) = 349977600 / 8 = 43747200
File size (kilobytes) = 43747200 / 1024 = 42721.88
File size (megabytes) = 42721.88 / 1024 = 41.72Mb
