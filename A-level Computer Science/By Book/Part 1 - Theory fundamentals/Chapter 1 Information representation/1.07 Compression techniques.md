# Lossless compression

> $Lossless \space compression$: coding techniques that allow subsequent decoding to recreate exactly the original file 

Keeps 100% of the information
Less free space than lossy after compression
Better quality

You use lossless wherever you must keep all of the data.

Text
Vector**
Vector images don’t have compression, because it’s built on math and coordinates, you don’t need to compress it. The quality will always be the same regardless of the size

There are many types of lossless compression:
Run Length Encoding
Huffman (not in syllabus)

# Lossy compression

> $Lossy \space compression$: coding techniques that cause some information to be lost so that the exact original file cannot be recovered in subsequent decoding

Remove redundant data
Creates smaller file size
Worse quality
Use in: Sound, Images, Video
